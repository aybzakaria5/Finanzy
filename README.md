## What is Hire Purchase?

Hire purchase (HP) is a method of buying goods through making installment payments over time. It allows the buyer to take immediate possession of the item while paying for it in regular installments. Ownership of the item is transferred to the buyer after the final payment is made. This method of financing is particularly beneficial for individuals who do not want to pay the full price upfront or are unable to do so.

It bridges the gap between traditional credit facilities and modern-day consumer needs.
